<p><em>My Girls</em></p>

<p>Two paragraphs about Amy:<p>
<p>I grew up in Kansas City and went to college at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>I worked as an Environmental Scientist in Chicago, working with EPA Region V and Jacob's Engineering.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are 
  so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so 
  blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that 
  are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their 
  duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through 
  shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
  to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is 
  untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we 
  like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. 
  But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the 
  obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have 
   to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always
   holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects 
   pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains
   to avoid worse pains."</p>
